## Project Task

Your project should have the following:

1. **Functionality with components** (e.g., buttons, text fields, togglers, etc.)
2. **Multiple views**
3. **A component to display information** (e.g., ListView)

You are free to add anything you think of.

Make your project look more like you. It can be, for example, custom **styles** or other **logic**.

## Project idea: Jyv채skyl채 Disc Golf Application
The idea behind this project is to create an application to do scores on my local (Jyv채skyl채) courses for disc golf. The course data is from https://frisbeegolfradat.fi/ and the data is in a .json format.
